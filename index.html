Unit 1: Data
bit: A binary digit, either 0 or 1. Learn more in Binary numbers.
byte: A sequence of 8 bits. Learn more in Bytes.
roundoff: Error that results when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number with full precision (like using 3 digits to represent  as 3.14). Learn more in Number limits, overflow, and roundoff.
analog data: Values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals, over time. For example, the pitch and volume of a live concert. Learn more in From analog to digital data.
lossless: Compressing data in a way that preserves all data away and allows full recovery of the original. Learn more in Data compression.
lossy: Compressing data in a way that discards some data and makes it impossible to recover the original. Learn more in Data compression.
metadata: Data about data, like descriptive information about a file or a row in a database.

Unit 2: Computer Systems and Networks – Review
Vocabulary
Computing Device: A physical device that can run a program (e.g., computer, smartphone, smart sensor).


Computer Network: A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.


Path: The series of connections between computing devices on a network, starting with the sender and ending with the receiver.


Protocol: An agreed-upon set of rules that specify how systems behave and communicate.


Fault Tolerant: A system’s ability to continue functioning even if individual components fail.


Scalability: The ability of a system to expand or contract to meet new demands.


Bandwidth: The maximum transmission capacity of a system, measured by bit rate (bits per second).


URL (Uniform Resource Locator): An easy-to-remember web address (e.g., www.example.com).


Internet Structure and Layers
Physical Network: The hardware and physical connections that carry internet signals.


Internet Protocol (IP): Assigns unique IP addresses to devices and determines how data is routed between them.


Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets.


User Datagram Protocol (UDP): A lightweight alternative to TCP with minimal error-checking (faster but less reliable).


Packets: Small chunks of data into which larger messages are divided for transmission. Packets may arrive in order, out-of-order, or not at all.


Routers: Specialized computers that forward data across networks, choosing the fastest available path.


Domain Name System (DNS): Translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses.


Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Used for transmitting and requesting web pages and media on the World Wide Web.


World Wide Web (WWW): A system of linked pages, media, and files browsable over HTTP.


Key Concepts
Message Delivery on the Internet: Messages are split into packets, which may take different paths through the network. The internet does not require a direct connection between sender and receiver.


Redundancy: Multiple pathways exist in the network so if one route fails, packets can take another.


Fault Tolerance: Because of redundancy, the internet can continue working even if parts of it are damaged.


Scalability: The internet is designed to grow and support billions of devices without redesigning its core structure.


IP Addressing and Encoding:


IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses → 232=4,294,967,2962^{32} = 4,294,967,296232=4,294,967,296 unique addresses.


Adding 16 more bits (IPv6) increases the address space by 216=65,5362^{16} = 65,536216=65,536 times.
